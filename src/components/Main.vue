            is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language that
            is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into
            HTML. Its syntax draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The main goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
            <strong>dynamically generated web pages</strong> quickly, but you
            can do much more with PHP.

            W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by
            <strong>78.1%</strong> of all the websites whose server-side
            programming language we know."

            PHP <strong>v8.0</strong> is a major update of the PHP language. It
            contains many new features and optimizations including named
            arguments, union types, attributes, constructor property promotion,
            match expression, nullsafe operator, JIT, and improvements in the
            type system, error handling, and consistency.
